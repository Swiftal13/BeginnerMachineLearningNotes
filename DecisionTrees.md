A decision tree is a type of supervised machine learning use to categorize and make predictions based on how previous questions were answered


## Classification and Regression
Two fundamental practices in supervised learning

# Classification
Classification, taking inputs and mapping it to a discrete label

**Instances** are inputted data values, discrete<br>
**Concept** is the function that maps the inputs to outputs<br>
**Target** is the answer we are trying to acheive<br>
**Hypothesis class** set of all concepts (classification functions) that you are considering<br>
the set of all possible decision trees<br>
**Sample** training set of  inputs paired with labels (correct output)<br>
**Candidate** is the hypotehtihs or concept that you think is the target concept





Regression, continuous value functions
