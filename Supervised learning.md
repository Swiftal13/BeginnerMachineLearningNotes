## Supervised Learning

A machine learning paradigm for problems that have its inputs and outputs, to figure and create potential algorithms that make the input into the output

inputs are called <b>feature vectors</b> in a ML model <br>
Outputs are called <b>Labels</b><br><br>

inputs and outputs are used to develop a predictive model<br>

**Training data** is the sample data given to build models


This can be referred as <b>functional approximation</b>, to create a function that generalizes beyong the outputs you have seen<br>

- the more eaxmples we have, the better we can approximate a function thats gets the feature vectors to the labels

## Induction vs Deduction

Induction refers to going from a specific examples to a more broad, general theory<br>
- In supervised learning this is applied by using training samples and new unseen examples, to learn a function
- the goal is to generalize the training data to predict future

Deduction is the reverse<br>
this is going from the broad general hypothesis to the specific example

Supervised learning is mostly induction, as we have the two data sets, but we go from the specific examples of training data, to predict a model, or approximate the function, which is the general rule
