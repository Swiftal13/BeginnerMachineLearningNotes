## Supervised Learning

A machine learning paradigm for problems that have its inputs and outputs, to figure and create potential algorithms that make the input into the output

inputs are called <b>feature vectors</b> in a ML model <br>
Outputs are called <b>Labels</b><br><br>

inputs and outputs are used to develop a predictive model<br>

Training data is the sample data given to build models

This can be referred as functional proximation, to create a function that generalizes beyong the outputs you have seen
