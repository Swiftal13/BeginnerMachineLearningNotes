## Rienforcement Learning

Another machine learning paradigm, concerning how intelligent agents can become through taking actions within an environment in order to maximise the idea of cumulative reward<br>

RL uses rewards and punishments as signals for positive and negative feedback for the agent, to then influence its actions in order to learn the optimal sequence of actions

The agent peforms an action within the environment<br>
It then gets a relative reward, which influences its state of action

<b>Agent</b>: The learner or decision maker that interacts with the environment<br>
<b>Environment</b>: The external system <br>
<b>Actions</b>: The choices available to the agent to take in a given state<br>
<b>State</b>: The current situation or condition of the environment<br>
<b>Policy</b>: The strategy or rule that the agent uses to determine its actions in a given state<br>
<b>Value function</b> An estimate of the expected cumlative reward that an agent can achieve from a given state<br>
<b>Q value</b> The expected cumlative reward for taking a specific action in a given state
