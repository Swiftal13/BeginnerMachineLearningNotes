## Rienforcement Learning

Another machine learning paradigm, concerning how intelligent agents can become through taking actions within an environment in order to maximise the idea of cumulative reward<br>

RL uses rewards and punishments as signals for positive and negative feedback for the agent, to then influence its actions in order to become better

The agent peforms an action within the environment<br>
It then gets a relative reward, which influences its state of action
