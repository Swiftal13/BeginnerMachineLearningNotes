## Unsupervised learning

No output data, just input data

generalization
MLP
compact
group data together depending on data
analyse patterns in data, and group them
they make their own data labels
Goal is to find patterns, structures or relationships within the data itself

a method used is called clustering 
actually it does predict ouputs, but it has no target
uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets

Supervised machine learning relies on labelled input and output training data, whereas unsupervised learning processes unlabelled or raw data.
