## introduction
Machine learning uses data to build a decision model
- decisions are made by deciphering relationships and patters using **probalitistic reasoning and trial and error**
- programmar chooses what data to input, what algorithm to apply (**Hyperparameters**)

parameters vs hyperparameters?

Machine learning utilises exposure to data to improve its decision making
