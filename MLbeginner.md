## introduction
Machine learning uses data to build a decision model
- decisions are made by deciphering relationships and patters using **probalitistic reasoning and trial and error**
- programmar chooses what data to input, what algorithm to apply (**Hyperparameters**)

parameters vs hyperparameters?

Machine learning utilises exposure to data to improve its decision making
Insufficient input data **restrcits the model's ability to deconstruct underlying patterns in data and limits its capacity tro respond to poteential variance and random phenomena** found in the live data.
good self learning model needs high exposure to input data, as it deepnds understanding of understanding to deconstruct underlying patterns

when feeding a model with training data, it can be regressive aswell. Giving irrelevant, biased data can be counter productive, and make a model less accurate

data optimisation and preparition to use on a model
column called vector. multiple vectors is matrix
